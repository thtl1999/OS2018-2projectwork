Phase 1
1.	Kind of Linux Kernel
Linux Kernel is the lowest level of software that manage resources effectively in Linux operating system. Linux use monolithic kernel system that include file system, scheduler, networking, memory management, IPC.
Among those, process scheduler is a basic element of multitasking operating systems such as Linux. We felt that process scheduling was quite interesting. And there is a lot of information about process scheduling. So, from these kernel systems, we select Linux scheduler to analyze and optimize.

2.	Introduction of Linux Scheduler
The purpose of the processor scheduler is to:
-	Decides the order that jobs/processes/requests called task in OS get processed.
-	Give a running system process a finite resource, called processor run time.
-	Ensure fast response time for each process.
-	Ensure good throughput of background jobs.
-	Prevent process starvation.
-	Maximize system utilization.
-	Give the user a feeling that multiple processes are running at the same time.
Linux Scheduling basic principles:
-	Scheduling policy: action that determines when and what the scheduler will run.
-	Time Sharing: Run as time quantum. Do Scheduling when it is done
-	Priority-based
	Static priority: Determine at runtime
	Dynamic priority: Variation during runtime monitoring
-	Preemptive Scheduling: If the unlocked block has a higher priority than the currently executing process, it immediately executes the higher priority task
Task is the smallest unit that can schedule process or thread in Linux. a Scheduling tasks effectively, one can make optimal use of the resources available in the computer.
5 scheduler kernels (Stop scheduler, Deadline scheduler, RT scheduler, CFS scheduler, Idle-task scheduler) are prepared, user task can choose each scheduler for selecting schedule policy.
Processing hierarchy is as follows.


Stop scheduler : Have highest priority. Not allow migration to another CPU. Reject all request. allow number of stop task and runtime calculation.
Deadline scheduler : Operate on EDF(Earliest Deadline First) + CBS(Constant Bandwidth Server) algorithm. DL task that approach deadline closely has higher priority.
RT scheduler : Using array called RT run queue, task are arranged as priority 0(highest) ~ 99(lowest).
CFS scheduler : Using red-black tree, implement time-line of task execution. As weight of task called ‘nice’, time slice is allocated to each task proportionately.
Idle-task scheduler : As lowest priority, always be preemption to operate another task. Idle task is designated per core.
